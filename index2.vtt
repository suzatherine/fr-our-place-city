00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:10.744
[audio playing...]

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
winter arrives again. And the new year

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.319
begins with the sound of rockets instead

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:20.939
of fireworks. When you walk today, maybe

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.259
you will pass one of your favorite

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.769
buildings in Liverpool. What loss would

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.289
you feel if it was no longer there? To

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.179
walk through our streets now has become

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:36.209
painful, physically painful to see the

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:39.034
destruction of theaters, museums,

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.189
libraries, churches, synagogues,

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.679
mosques, you can recognize the

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.989
historical face of a city through its

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.309
buildings. You can't imagine how much

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.844
heritage you will not manage to rebuild.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:56.819
cherished memories in our favorite

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.619
places are now scarred as joy from the

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:17.015
past becomes distorted in the present.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
Time stopped and he doesn't move any

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.235
more. Time was short with air bombs.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.230
Time was raped, collectively and

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.670
deliberately. Time lies in the world and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.490
waits for the spring waters to bring its

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
body to the surface. For this spring

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.820
waters do not come. Because time does

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.090
not exist anymore. And there is no

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.935
spring and there is no water to come.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.165
And there is no sun to rise and set.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.150
There is endless February and we're all

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.750
in it. Children lose the ability to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.220
walk. They forget the words, they cling

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.500
to the mothers, as if they want to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.820
return to the womb. There is no way back

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.200
and there is no way forward. There is an

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.740
infinite now. And the damn plane

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.290
endlessly circles and circles and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.470
circles. Even though it was shot down a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
long time ago. It is still there in the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.490
sky above us can use some of the new

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:52.265
world.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.480
As you walk, listen to the different

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.380
sounds of the city. Maybe you can hear

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.770
cars, bosses, people talking on the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.660
phones and to each other. silence now

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.880
shapes the landscapes of our towns and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.570
cities on the frontline. It is literally

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.910
something from another dimension. It is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.580
painful and scary for me. Now, when I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.890
walk the streets in hierarchy, I rarely

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.720
see car so people the shops and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.845
buildings, a place of plus decoration,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.420
as emptiness and silence the place

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.045
something that was once full of life.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.810
Maybe you experienced this during the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.050
lockdown, a distant memory for you.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.340
After everything went back to normal. We

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.220
are not in normal circumstances. To

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.950
silent here because many people are gone

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.555
as our cities, our culture, our country

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.170
is being erased from the Earth's

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.430
surface. And I asked activists and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.910
artists on the show Regina, what song we

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.970
could play after hearing her story. She

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.830
told me she had stopped listening to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.640
music. You need to be able to hear the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.790
air raid alarm she said So play that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.317
silence

00:04:30.342 --> 00:06:00.079
