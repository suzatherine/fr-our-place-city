00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.499
Why do people internationally only want

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.039
to see us as victims on this percolating

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.189
on our tears and blood, romanticizing

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.399
the violence. It is offensive for those

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.049
who come from colonial and Imperial

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:24.779
countries to realize that we are equals

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.379
or more beautiful people with a rich

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.129
cultural heritage. across the ages,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.069
Russia stole not only our art objects,

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.669
but our rights to self determination. We

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:40.619
are fighting for the rights to build our

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:45.119
own identity. I am a woman with strength

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.389
with anger and the power to create bring

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:51.904
into light our spirits, our own beliefs

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.939
within humanity and this new

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.199
circumstances. We are considering what

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.239
the new function of art is in a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.909
narrative without imperialism, and

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.949
people like activist and artists and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.529
ushering in a fighting for all of this,

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.019
it's a moment when the most important

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:23.405
case is also to survive.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.030
All of us were scared. We didn't expect

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.455
this. I understand that that was stupid.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.390
But still, I didn't believe this would

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.410
happen. But after one month, we began to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.450
have many meetings with our teammates

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.880
there, the Organization for Women of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.550
hockey, including lesbian and bisexual

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.340
women. We started to talk about how we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.650
could support the community raising

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.670
money for food, clothing medicine. At

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.320
the same time, we understood that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960
homophobia and misogyny are still

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.020
present in our society. And we wanted to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.420
show what women and the LGBT plus

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.090
community are doing for our victory,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.340
which shows the format of performance

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.800
interventions in the city. Because large

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.750
scale public gatherings are banned

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.410
during wartime. The first intervention

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.080
was just me and my girlfriend, were

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.905
created this procession with two flags,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.270
one for Ukraine and the other, the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.380
lesbian flag for hockey bride. We were

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.235
scared just to walk on the streets.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.850
There had been a lot of air raid

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.020
signals, many bombs and rockets. But we

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.935
tried to say something to ourselves,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600
that we can walk in the city, even if

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
the buildings are destroyed, to show

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.040
that we are brave, even in these

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.730
moments, to say that we stayed in our

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.725
own city, and we are who we are.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.000
The next intervention was a performance

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.465
with a bit of silence.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.920
There was a lot of flowers, rainbow

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.140
flags and candles, remembering all the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.000
Ukrainian heroes who were killed in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.210
Dubai done in 2014. And the Russian was

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.830
on Ukraine since aloe vera, one of our

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.530
volunteers for Hodgkin pride was in our

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.465
administration building on a rocket hit.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.440
He had slept there because she was a

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.335
volunteer in the kitchen. And she died.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.220
My girlfriend's has no rights to ask

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.560
about her body, or to help her parents

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.130
with a funeral. So in this performance,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.595
we remembered Olivia two

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.140
after that, we created a performance

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.660
with a rainbow car recreating a lesbian

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.300
wedding, which were covered in many

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.175
ribbons and words for marriage equality.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.330
We created a performance about the wives

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.420
of Russian rapists. We made this protest

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.290
after Bucha because I realized that if I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.450
didn't do anything, it would make me

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.370
crazy. That I must say something. After

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.500
Bucha all Ukrainian woman understood

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.690
that it would be with our bodies with

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.970
our daughters bodies. We hold this

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.930
trauma. So we gathered stuff similar to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.690
what they steal, clothes, underwear

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.300
electronics, and we left it near the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.670
Russian cancel and Harkey with a poster

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.070
that said for the wives of Russian

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:52.715
rapists.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740
Before the 24th of February, Harkin had

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.990
a lot of trade with Russia, and people

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.630
came here to work. Go to the theater

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.810
cinema. We didn't take Russia. But it is

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.700
important how many people change their

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.255
minds are the first I was a pacifist.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.680
And now I'm really confused with what I

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.100
can do with my peaceful beliefs and how

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.970
I can realize my own value. It's

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.160
important to continue to choose human

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160
rights every time. This is why we

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.040
continue to organize our events, to make

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.470
sure we have our place in our own city

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.490
to speak aloud. Because we are fighting

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.580
not only against the Russian army, we

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.620
are fighting for our values.

00:05:43.645 --> 00:06:02.658
